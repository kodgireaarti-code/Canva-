- Recently, I did hands-on practice by creating digital pamphlets and a short promotional video for my digital marketing institute, and this practice really helped me understand how content planning and creative design work together in real marketing.
- For this practice, I used ChatGPT to plan the content and messaging. I took help in structuring headlines, short taglines, course highlights, and call-to-action lines so that the message is clear, simple, and marketing-friendly. This step helped me focus on what exactly I want to communicate before starting the design.
- After finalising the content, I used Canva to design the pamphlets and create the video. I selected suitable layouts and then customised them by changing colours, fonts, images, and spacing to match a professional education brand look. I also focused on keeping the designs clean so that the information is easy to read and visually appealing on social media.
- The main purpose of this practice was to create creatives that are not just good-looking, but also useful for promotion, where viewers can quickly understand the course details and what action they should take next.
- Through this practice, I learned that strong creatives start with clear content first and design second. ChatGPT helped me with idea generation and content structure, while Canva helped me turn those ideas into actual visuals and videos.
- This practice helped me improve my skills in:
content planning using AI,
basic graphic and video design using Canva,
and creating marketing-ready creatives for education brands.

Still learning, practicing, and improving my creative and marketing skills every day 🚀✨
